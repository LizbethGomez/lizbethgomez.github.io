I'm currently a doctoral candidate at Drexel University's [Dornsife School of Public Health](https://drexel.edu/dornsife/academics/departments/environmental-occupational-health/eoh-student-profiles/) in Philadelphia and a [GATHER Fellow](https://drexel.edu/dornsife/global/global-health-training/gather/). I am working under the advisement of Dr. Jane Clougherty on determining pharmaceutical treatment efficacy modification by Social and Environmental exposures. Previously, I received an MPH in Environmental Health Science from [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/environmental-health-sciences-ehs)  and a Bachelors of Science from the [City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/). ~~~~~

My research interests are in epidemiological and biostatistical methods as well as asthma disparities. I first developed these interests as a fellow in the [Puerto Rico IPE Service Learning Fellowship](http://https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/office-diversity-culture-and-inclusion/puerto-rico-ipe-service-learning-trip-0), where I got to work inter-professionally with a multidisciplinary team and develop a community-based participatory and service learning research project in San Juan, Puerto Rico. These interests have continued beyond my experience as a fellow, and have become a motivation for producing meaningful and reproducible research.

I am a **huge** foodie, I visit NYC (where I am from) as often as my PhD training allows. When I am not gardening, you can find me cuddling with my Bichon-Frise puppy, Lilu, baking, reading (fiction, too) or coding in R.
